# Marginal false discovery rates for penalized regression models

This repository contains the code to reproduce the results in [Marginal false discovery rates for penalized regression models](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1607.05636), by Patrick Breheny.
The `mfdr` function, which actually calculates the marginal false discovery rates, is implemented in [`ncvreg`](https://github.com/pbreheny/ncvreg).


Note: Due to restrictions on the sharing of human genetic data, I am unable to provide the data necessary to reproduce the analyses in Section 6.3.  All other analyses in the manuscript are covered by this repository.
